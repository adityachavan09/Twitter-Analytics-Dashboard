# Twitter Analytics Dashboard

This repository showcases an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline for processing unstructured data obtained from the Twitter API. The data is first extracted from Twitter using Python, and subsequently cleaned and processed to ensure data quality and accuracy. The processed data is then ingested into a PostgreSQL database for storage and analysis.

Moreover, this project also includes a data visualization component that presents the extracted data in an intuitive and insightful manner. The [visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/TwitterDashboard_16725363514990/TwitterAnalyticsDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) serves to provide key insights and trends within the data set, thereby aiding decision-making processes and enhancing overall understanding.

Overall, this repository demonstrates an end-to-end ETL pipeline for handling unstructured data from Twitter, and leverages data visualization techniques to deliver actionable insights from the processed data.
