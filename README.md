# twitter_analytics
This repository is the implementation of a ETL pipeline where the Data is extracted from Twitter API, cleaned and processed using Python and then ingested into a PostgreSQL database.
I also have created a [data visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/TwitterDashboard_16725363514990/TwitterAnalyticsDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)using the extracted data.
